# Fucolicious - A Custom Food App

Our new Flutter project.

## Getting Started with our App

I am very delighted to publish our Freshman year project 'Fucolicious'. Fucolicious is a food delivery app (uses drones to deliver food), but not just another food delivery app. 
- In this app, you can customize literally anything starting from the temperature of your coffee to the intensity of the flavor in your ice cream, the sugar type in your coffee, and every layer of your burger.
- We used Flutter for frontend, Firebase as database, Python for APIs, and Google Cloud's Dialogflow to create our very own voice assistant which is linked with Google Assistant.
- The UI was designed in Adobe XD and Adobe Photoshop.
- Weather API using Python - It scraps the current weather details and will let us know if the drones can fly in the current weather conditions.
- Translation API using Python.

I really have to talk about my team - Ashwin Karthick, Nithiin, KAVIN ARAVINDHAN R, ASWATH HARISH, Sivasaran T. Even though most of them were new to programming, they spent so much time and effort to learn new things and present such a wonderful project in a short span of time.

Do have a look at the App!
