  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Antipasto Pro
      fonts:
        - asset: assests/fonts/Antipasto-Pro-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 900

        - asset: assests/fonts/Comfortaa-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700

        - asset: assests/fonts/Kenyan-Coffee-Regular-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
